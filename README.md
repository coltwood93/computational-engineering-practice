# Computational Engineering Practice

This repository contains my solutions and "bridge projects" as I work through my career transition plan. The goal is to apply Computer Science principles to solve Mechanical Engineering problems using modern C++ and Python.

## Tech Stack
- C++ (Modern C++17/20)
- Python 3 (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- CMake
- Git

## Projects
*(coming soon)*
